主题：

A View from Across the Pacific: Chinese Perceptions of the United States

  

说明：

Large amount of ink has been spilled in the last few years--and even more so
since COVID-19--in the U.S. regarding American perceptions of the P.R.C.
Relatively little, however, has been conveyed regarding how China might view
the U.S. today. In this talk, we bring together two eminent professors,
Professor Jia Qingguo and Professor Wang Dong, from the School of
International Studies, Peking University, to examine how policymakers,
professionals, and average citizens in China might perceive the United States
and what that might imply for the U.S.-China bilateral relationship. Dr.
Thomas Fingar, Shorenstein APARC Fellow, will moderate the conversation.  
  
Presented by the APARC China Program.  
  
Speakers: Dr. Thomas Fingar, Professor Jia Qingguo, Professor Wang Dong
