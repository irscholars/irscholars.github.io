 **********内容概要** **：** Since the End of The Cold War, Globalisation Has Been
the Dominant Political and Economic Trend. But What Is China’s Role in
Globalisation? What Is China’s Vision of The World? This Title Offers a Fresh
and Stimulating Account of How China's Involvement in Globalisation Has
Changed Over Time, and How Its Role in Leading The “Re-Globalisation” Process
Is Profoundly Reshaping the World. Introducing an Innovative Theoretical
Framework in The Shape of “Re-Globalisation”, This Book Discusses China’s
Strategies and Challenges While Interacting with The International Community.
The Book Provides Several Illuminating Case Studies, Such as The Belt and Road
Initiative (BRI), The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), And the
Strategies of The Chinese Technology Firm Alibaba. Rich in Data and Bold In
Argument, The Book Provides An Extraordinarily Dynamic Depiction Of How
China’s Encounter With The Outside World Has Not Only Transformed Itself, But
Also Reshaped The Global Order. As the First Systemic and Book-Length Study Of
“Re-Globalisation”, This Volume Will Appeal to Researchers and Students of
Politics and Chinese Studies, And Contemporary Chinese Politics in Particular.
